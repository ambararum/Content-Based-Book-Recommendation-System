# 🚀 How to Run the App
To run this application, make sure you have the following files ready:
1. merged_books_data.xlsx
2. cosine_similarity_matrix.pkl
3. tfidf_vectorizer.pkl
4. tfidf_matrix.pkl

These files are generated by running the provided .ipynb notebook located in the **Recommender System** directory.

## 📥 Steps:
1. Download or generate the files by executing the Jupyter Notebook in the **Recommender System** folder.
2. Place all the generated files into the application directory (same folder as app.py).

⚠️ Note: The file cosine_similarity_matrix.pkl is quite large (~1.7 GB), so loading may take some time.

Run the app using Streamlit:
*streamlit run app.py*

🎉 Done! The app will open in your browser, ready for use.
