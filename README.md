# 📚 Content-Based Book Recommendation System
Using Cosine Similarity and Streamlit.
This project is a content-based recommendation system that suggests books based on user preferences using cosine similarity between book descriptions. The app is built with Python and uses Streamlit for an interactive web interface.

## 🔍 How It Works
- The system uses a TF-IDF vectorizer to transform book descriptions into numerical vectors.
- Cosine similarity is then calculated to find books with similar content.
- Users can input a book key words and the system returns a list of recommended books with similar themes or genres.

## 💡 Features
- 🔎 Search by key words to get personalized recommendations
- ⚡ Fast and lightweight using cosine similarity
- 🖥️ Built with Streamlit for an intuitive and user-friendly UI
- 📄 Based on book metadata (tittle, description, genre, and author)
